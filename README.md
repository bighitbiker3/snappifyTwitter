# Snappify Your Twitter

Use this little Node.JS app to delete your tweets once they're 24hrs old. This does not include RT's.  To include RT's look in line 15 of the deleteTweets.js file and change 'include_rts' to true.

I just run this on my local machine 24/7 as I didn't want to pay for hosting :).  

Don't forget to include your keys at the top of the deleteTweets.js file!
